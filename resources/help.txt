The objective of this game is to accumulate money. This is done by selling resources to inhabited regions. Resources can be extracted from areas within uninhabited regions. There are various types of areas, including mountains, forests and lakes, each having its own available resource types. Extracted resources can be converted into other resources using processors (see the Conversion tab). Each processor has a resource cost to be built. You can see the cost by hovering over the processor's name in the dialog opened by the add button in the conversion tab.

Tips:

 - Start by extracting coal and iron ore, then smelt it in the furnace you start with to get iron. You can then build other types of processors with the iron.

 - Some processors, including refineries, require microchips. However, crafing microchips requires plastic, which is made in a refinery, which poses a problem. You can solve this problem by generating regions until you find an inhabited region with a microchip for sale. With the first few microchips you purchase, you should build a refinery so you can produce more microchips yourself.

 - Some resources won't replenish in an area if they drop below a certain threshold. For fish and humans, the threshold is two. Wood replenishes in a forest as long as there's some amount left, but the replenishment speed is proportional to the amount of wood present.

 - Double click a resource in the Market tab to sell/buy it. Double click a resource in the input table of the Crafting tab to move it back to your inventory, or in the output table to craft it. Double click a resource in the Conversion tab to move it to your inventory.

 - If you see a red extraction label (e.g., "<span foreground="red">- 1/s</span>") next to a resource in the Region tab, you can double click it to cancel that extraction.

 - Areas you own are colored green in the Region tab.
